# newsFeedApp
This app will get all the current news.
It will have a tab Breaking News with all the breaking news availible.
It will have a tab Saved, which will have all the articles which you saved in your device. I did that using room library for settting a database for this.
Saved tab will also have an option to delete an article or undo a deleted article.
There will be a tab for searching news. Where one can search news by typing the name for it. For example news related corona.
After taping on an article you can view it in a web view and it will have floating shape at the bottom, which you can use to save that article for reading it later.
